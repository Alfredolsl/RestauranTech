# RestauranTech

# Introduction
## The project
RestauranTech is a web application designed to optimize restaurant operations through advanced inventory management, cost control, and supplier price analysis. The app allows restaurants to manage the stock of ingredients, beverages, and other supplies in real-time, as well as monitor and control expenses related to purchases.
